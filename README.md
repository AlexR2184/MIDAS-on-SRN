# SRN_MIDAS

This is a repository containing the processed data used in the project titled, "Data-Driven Traffic Assignment Through Density-Based Road-Specific Congestion Function Estimation".

The data set is for the England Strategic Road Network. It was created using MIDAS traffic data from the period September 2018 to May 2019. 

The methodology for producing the processed data from the raw data is described in the paper "Data-Driven Traffic Assignment Through Density-Based Road-Specific Congestion Function Estimation", IEEE Access (tbc).
